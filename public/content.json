I hack on open source projects (my own, Charm's, and others) in public on my Twitch channel. I also have a YouTube channel where I post more curated content on what I'm learning. I love long form content because I resent how social media platforms can feel like a highlight reel of people's lives, when in reality, we all struggle, especially when coding (heh).",
